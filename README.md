# Brain-Tumors-Image-Classification
Brain tumor detection using convolutional neural networks and transfer learning. Training and testing the models with Adam and RMSprop optimizers, a number of 64
and 128 batches, and for transfer learning three different architecture models were used. The three architecture models are MobileNetV2, VGG19, and ResNet101V2. 

Transfer Learning had way better accuracy and loss results than conventional neural networks. However, in transfer learning, ResNet101V2 had the highest accuracy rate at 81.73% with batch number 128 using RMSprop optimizer and the lowest loss rate at 248.79% with batch number 128 using Adam optimizers.
